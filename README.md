## 2. As a user, I want the system to keep me signed in, so I don't need to put my credentials every time I open the system


## 3. As a user, I want to have a feedback if I fill the wrong credentials, so I know that I did something wrong and I can fix it
## 4. As a user, I want to have a home page with my profile, so I can see my personal info
## 5. As a user, I want to have a logout button, so when I am finished, I can log out of my account
